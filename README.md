KritZu
======

KritZu is a playlist generator based on folder structure. It generates playlists in compatible format to Zune, Windows Media player and Windows Phone.

I created this long time back to upload bunch of our old songs from CDs arranged via mood & genre into Zune, which did not have capability of creating playlists looking at the folder structure.  I think the format of the playlist was derived from Windows Media Player and still lives on Windows Phone so essentially you can use it create playlists on Windows Phone too.

If you have any questions drop me a line on twitter @vishalrjoshi.  Hope this helps!!
